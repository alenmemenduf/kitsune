# Kitsune
A Unity2D prototype platformer made for the **jamdecasa.ro 2020 Game Jam**. 
It was also the **first Unity game I made**, so Cristi helped a lot.

## The jam
* It was a __3-days long__ game jam. 
* The theme was __"You only have 5 minutes!"__.
* There were 72 teams in total that participated and raised __40.710 RON__ through donations from partner companies and people that watched the stream where the games were played.

## How we made it
1. Given 3-days we had to build something *fast* and *easy* with challenging gameplay.
2. The theme was pretty rigid and we had to come up with gameplay that could be a challenge for up to 5 minutes.
3. We came up with the idea to make a *2D stealth platformer*. **[Kitsune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune)** is actually the word for Fox in Japanese and is meant to be slick and tricky. 
4. Not knowing exactly how hard it was to implement a *grappling hook* that works with Rigidbody, and it being one of the *core mechanics*, it took us too much, so we scrapped the idea.
5. Because of point 4 we had to rush changing placeholders in the level to actual sprites. Lesson learned, **scrap bad ideas faster**.
6. After the jam, Cristian changed most of the sprites and the level too.
7. We used Unity's **Collaborate** for version control, after the jam I found out you can export the git commit history to **Github**.

## The team
* [Alen Memenduf](https://github.com/alenmemenduf) - programmed player and simple enemy path, level design, managed camera.
* [Cristian Rosiu](https://github.com/cristianrosiu) - programmed player and enemies' detection mechanic, UI menu, drawn the player sprite.

 The items written above were the main focus of each of us. It was a team's work so the game design, play-testing, choosing assets, and overall decisions were done together.
